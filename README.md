## Bio

Helloooooo! I'm Jackson Gray, a 20-year-old software engineer currently living in Denver, Colorado. My passion for programming began in my childhood, sparked by a love for video games and the desire to create my own Minecraft mods and servers for my friends and I to enjoy.

Despite a rough start to my education, I rediscovered my love for programming a year after graduating from high school. Determined to turn my passion into a career, I enrolled in Columbia College Chicago to study programming. However, I soon realized that I craved a more immersive and challenging learning experience.

That's when I discovered coding bootcamps and made the decision to attend Flatiron School in Denver. Here, I found a supportive community and an engaging learning environment that allowed me to thrive. I'm currently working on numerous personal projects, honing my skills in data structures, algorithms, team collaboration and the flow of software projects.

Throughout my journey, I've become proficient in various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, PHP, and C#. I'm also familiar with frameworks and libraries like Flask, React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. I'm constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and am eager to learn more, with a particular interest in Rust, C++, and similar system level languages.

When I'm not coding, you can find me working on my BMW M3, attending car shows, or watching a movie with my adorable cat, Lyla. I also enjoy playing Spikeball with my friends on a nice day.

I'm excited about the future of technology and am particularly intrigued by the potential of artificial intelligence in the field of software engineering. As I continue to grow professionally, my long-term goals include working for a major tech company, starting my own business, and eventually securing a remote position that allows me to live alone in the mountains of Colorado or Montana.

If you'd like to connect or learn more about my work, feel free to reach out via LinkedIn, Github, Instagram, or email. I'm always happy to chat about technology, collaborate on projects, or simply exchange ideas!
