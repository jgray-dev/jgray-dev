## Me
I'm a software engineer with a diverse background that combines technical expertise with real-world problem-solving skills. After completing Flatiron School's full-stack development program, I've developed proficiency in multiple programming languages including TypeScript, Python, and C#, while working on projects ranging from AI-integrated educational platforms to cloud-based applications. My five years in hospitality have honed my ability to work effectively under pressure, collaborate with teams, and maintain a strong customer focus. I'm particularly passionate about creating practical solutions that have meaningful impact, and I continuously seek to expand my technical knowledge while applying my unique blend of skills to new challenges.
